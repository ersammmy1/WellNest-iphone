Key Features of the WellNest App

Personalized Dashboard
	Upon launching WellNest, users are welcomed with a personalized dashboard displaying a list of their connected loved ones. Each person’s name is accompanied by a color-coded indicator or symbol reflecting their current well-being status. This feature enables users to quickly assess the emotional landscape of their innermost circle.

Mood Indicators
	Users can select from a customized set of mood indicators or emojis that best represent their current emotional state. This intuitive method of expression allows for open communication without the necessity for lengthy explanations, facilitating a culture of transparency and care.

Connection Awareness
	WellNest offers an overview of the well-being statuses of your connection network at a glance. By identifying individuals who might be experiencing challenges, users can promptly reach out with support—whether it’s through a message, a call, or an in-person visit—strengthening ties when they are most needed.

Effortless Communication
	With a simple tap, users can initiate direct communication with a loved one who might need extra attention, fostering stronger relationships. WellNest is designed to enhance, not replace, meaningful interactions within your personal community.
